    '''  Assumptions made for this task:
     - Background colour for this task is always black (colour code 0).
     - Always outputs to a 3x3 grid.
     - The shape we wish to emulate in the output will always have a width greater 
       than one grid unit, otherwise it is 'noise'. 
       
       Transformation carried out:
       1. The 'noise' is detected and wiped from the grid, with the noise colour being identified 
       as the first row-wise element to be detected which has a different colour to neighbouring row elements, as per assumptions above.
       2. Rows and columns consisting solely background colour (black) are removed.
       3. The resulting array shape is mapped to the 3x3 grid. The resulting array is assumed to divide in 3 in both dimensions for this mapping, 
       and this is performed to carry out the mapping.
       
    All of the training/test grids appear to solve succesfully with this function.

    ''' Assumptions made for this task:
      - background for inputs is always black (colour code 0)
    Â  - orientation of shapes is always correct for combination (rotation of shapes not required)
      - output is always 3x3 
      - always involves combining 2 shapes, not more - and shapes completely fill the 3x3 output
      - the two shapes always have distinct colours
    
    Transformation carried out: 
    1. The set of distinct colours in the grid is determined, and the background colour removed from this set.
    2. The grid is attempted to be split in two, to achieve each of the shapes in an individual array.
    If the split is carried out and one of the resulting arrays is empty (all background), the split is repeated for the non-empty array.
    Otherwise, the two arrays are tested to ensure that each shape has been partitioned fully into each of the resultant arrays.
    This is done by ensuring the same colour isn't present across both arrays.
    3. If the arrays fail this task, the split is re-performed on a different axis on the grid. 
    All the different possible splitting axes (in the x and y directions) are iterated over until
    a working split has been found.
    4. Then, rows and columns consisting solely background colour (black) are removed from the two arrays.
    5. Next, if the resulting arrays are less than the output shape (3x3), they are padded to reach this shape.
    We do not know how these shapes should be padded, so padding is repeatedly randomly performed until 
    the padded 3x3 shape and the other shape (possibly also needing randomised padding), add together to give an array with no 
    background elements present. Since the set of possible shapes which need padding (such as 2x2, 3x2, 1x2 arrays, etc) 
    is quite small - the randomised padding works efficiently enough. I felt this was more efficient than hardcoding all possible paddings for all possible shapes.
    6. The array which the two individual arrays combine with no background elements, 
    is returned as the output.
    
    All of the training/test grids appear to solve succesfully with this function.
